    "question": "Which of the following is a necessary condition for a deadlock to occur?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Mutual exclusion",
      "B": "Hold and wait",
      "C": "No preemption",
      "D": "All of the above"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "All four conditions (mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait) must be satisfied for a deadlock to occur."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is NOT a way to prevent deadlocks?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Resource allocation graph analysis",
      "B": "Deadlock detection",
      "C": "Resource allocation order",
      "D": "Resource reservation"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Deadlock detection is used to identify deadlocks after they have occurred, not to prevent them. Prevention methods include resource allocation order, resource reservation, and banker's algorithm."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the circular wait condition in the context of deadlocks?",
    "options": {
      "A": "A process must hold a resource for an extended period of time",
      "B": "A process must hold a resource while waiting for another process to release a resource",
      "C": "A process must be allocated all the resources it needs to execute",
      "D": "A process must be allocated all the resources it needs to execute in a circular manner"
    },
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The circular wait condition is when a set of processes exists such that each process is waiting for a resource held by the next process in a circular chain. This is a necessary condition for a deadlock."

  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the banker's algorithm?",
    "options": {
      "A": "To detect deadlocks",
      "B": "To prevent deadlocks",
      "C": "To resolve deadlocks",
      "D": "To optimize resource allocation"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The banker's algorithm is a prevention method used to prevent deadlocks by ensuring that no deadlock can occur. It works by allocating resources to processes and checking if the process could still run even if all requests are granted. If not, the algorithm denies further requests."

      "C": "Resolving deadlocks",
      "D": "Optimizing resource allocation"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The resource allocation graph is used to analyze potential deadlocks. It represents the system's resource allocation state, with nodes representing processes and edges representing resource requests. If a cycle exists, a deadlock is possible."
